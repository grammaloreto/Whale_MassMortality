# Largest Mass Mortality in Baleen Whales

## Analysing this event with code and CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Service) data.

- Place: Chilean Patagonia
- Specie: Sei Whale (*Baleanoptera borealis*)
- Number of death Whales in one event: between 300 - 400
- Time: March 2015

Mass Mortality Events (MME) are well know in tooth whales but are rare in baleen whales because usually they are not gregarius species. This social behaviour is a very strong consideration to determine possible causes. Harmful Algae Bloom (HAB), particularly the genus *Alexandrium* with production of paralytic shellfish toxins and the oceanographic phenomena such as El Niño are the main hypotesis of this tragic event that compromises all conservation efforts of these species.


### Results

- Chlorophyll concentrations was quantify and during the first months of 2015 (when the event happened) are visible zones near the shore (where the whales feed) with high concentrations of algae. With the CMEMS datasets of dinoflagellates (*Alexandrium sp.*) in March of 2015 patchs of this organisms are visibles near the places where the corpuses were found.

- Sea Surface Temperature (SST) were high in that area during the years were the bodies were found. The high temperatures are consequence of 'El Niño' event. 2013 -2017 were especially hot years for the Pacific that contributes to HAB.

- Hypoxic Conditions in the surface and in deeper waters might contribute in the negative effects of the whales environment.

- The wind was considerate to have an idea where the whales were arrasted by the currents.
