# Largest Mass Mortality in Baleen Whales

## Analysing the event with code and CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Service) data.

- Place: Chilean Patagonia
- Specie: Sei Whale (*Baleanoptera borealis*)
- Number of death Whales in one event: between 300 - 400
- Time: March 2015

Mass Mortality Events (MME) are well know in tooth whales but are rare in baleen whales because usually they are not gregarius species. This social behaviour is a very strong argument to determine possible causes. Harmful Algae Bloom (HAB), particularly the genus *Alexandrium* with production of paralytic shellfish toxins and climate phenomena such as El Niño are the main hypotesis of this tragic event that compromises all conservation efforts of these species.


### Results

- Sea Surface Chlorophyll was quantify and during the first months of 2015 (when the event happened) are visible zones near the shore (feeding areas) with high concentration of algae. With CMEMS datasets of dinoflagellates (*Alexandrium sp.*), in March of 2015 patchs of these organisms are visible near the places where the corpuses were found.

- Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is high in that area during those years. High temperatures are consequence of 'El Niño' event. 2013 -2017 were especially hot years for the Pacific, involving HAB.

- Hypoxic conditions in surface and deeper waters might contribute in the negative effects of whales environment.

- Considerating the wind direction to have an idea where the whales were dragged by the currents.
